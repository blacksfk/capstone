            <p>The Indonesian program is facilitated by Monique Breen and is supported by teaching staff within their classroom programs. It is a language awareness program, giving students a introduction to some basic conversation, greetings, numbers and colours, telling the time, classroom vocabulary etc

			The Courtenay Gardens Primary School "Morning Show" is used to introduce and reinforce weekly phrases or vocabulary such as greetings and basic pleasantries, numbers, colours and telling the time. Grade six students also receive Indonesian sessions with Miss Breen.

			With our Indonesian Cultural Program, we have been very lucky at Courtenay Gardens Primary School to have various performing groups visit demonstrating Arts and Culture such as music, dance and puppetry.</p>
