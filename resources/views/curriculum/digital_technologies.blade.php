            <p><strong>Why teach Digital Technologies</strong></p>
            <p>The Victorian Digital Technologies Curriculum is designed to help our students become creators of digital solutions rather than simply passive users of technology. All schools in Victoria are meant to teach this exciting new curriculum which includes understanding how digital devices work, coding and other principles involved with using technology creatively to solve real life problems. </p>


            <p>The computer lab classes teach the new Victorian Digital Technologies curriculum and includes teaching coding using our Dash and Dot robots across all year levels. Cyber safety lessons are taught at the beginning of the year, concentrating on the digital footprint students create when online, how to stay safe and become good digital citizens. To increase our students’ vocabulary knowledge all classes are also taught a new word connected to technology and computers. </p>

            <p>The school’s laptop program complements the classroom curriculum allowing the students and teachers to learn how ICT can benefit their understanding of Literacy, Mathematics and Integrated Studies.The Multimedia Program is a unique program where students primarily use iPads to complete various weekly challenges that are linked to the new Digital Technologies Curriculum. In addition to the above, students in Grade 5 and 6 have the opportunity to host and produce "The Morning Show!" "The Morning Show" is an award-winning television program which is broadcast each morning throughout the school to every classroom. More details on "The Morning Show" and the Multimedia Program can be viewed from  </p>

            <p><strong>How is the program structured?</strong><br>Lab: Each grade is assigned a 45-minute lesson per week in the computer lab or Multimedia Studio for three terms. <br> Laptop Program: Each grade is allocated, on average, 1 full day per term with the laptops. This allows for an extra 20 hours of dedicated ICT-focused learning per student per year. </p>
