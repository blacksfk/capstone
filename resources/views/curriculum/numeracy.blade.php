                            At Courtenay Gardens Primary School we have a whole school focus on improving Mathematics results and Numeracy understandings. Improvement in Mathematics has been a major focus and is a priority area in our School Strategic Plan.
                            </p>
                        
                            <p>
                            We firmly believe that every child can achieve success, given sufficient time and assistance. As dedicated educators, we are committed to achieving this goal through our model. This includes a process for the continuous monitoring and assessment of student progress, to understand the learning needs of our students. We closely track our students by <strong>pre and post testing</strong> all children on a regular basis. After pretesting children we moderate in grade teams to ensure we are planning explicitly for the needs of our children.
                            </p>

                            <p>We analyse our National Testing (NAPLAN) data and develop a plan as a whole school to focus on ‘The Big Three’ areas that need extra attention in our programs. This is reviewed annually.</p>

                            <p>We ensure all important aspects of Mathematics are being taught; <strong>automatic facts, times tables and problem solving</strong> through differentiated learning and a whole/small/whole classroom model.</p>

                            <p>We have high expectations that all children will be proficient in times table knowledge by grade 4. All grades have times tables they need to develop by the end of their year level;</p>

                            <p>Prep - Conting patterns - 1's, 5's and 10's</p><br>
                            Times tables:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Grade 1 - 2's, 5's and 10's</li>
                                <li>Grade 2 - 3's, 4's and 11's</li>
                                <li>Grade 3 - 6's, 7's and 8's</li>
                                <li>Grade 4 - 9's and 12's</li>
                                <li>Grade 5-6 - revision, development of speed</li>
                            </ul>


                            <p>We have a common approach to Problem Solving. All grades work on the same problem solving strategy at the same time. We use a ‘Four Step Problem Solving ‘ model throughout the school and have provided consistent support material in every classroom to assist with teaching this area. High quality work that the children have produced is proudly displayed on a common display board near the staffroom for all to see.</p>

                            <p>Extensive professional development is provided to all staff in all areas of mathematics.</p>

                            We deliver this through:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Peer modelling and colleague visits.</li>
                                <li>Regular professional development sessions at staff meetings that specifically revise the structure of classroom management and problem solving strategies.</li>
                                <li>Teacher self-evaluation and reflection.</li>    
                            </ul>

                            <p>We cater for all learning needs and styles in Mathematics, including those children seen to be needing additional assistance. The Numeracy Improvement Program has been designed to improve the mathematical skills and understandings of students identified as performing under and above the expected grade levels.</p>

                            <p>We have support teachers at every year level working with small groups of children that need extra support. We also work closely with parents and students to ensure that comprehensive Individual Learning Plans are maintained and that children’s Numeracy learning needs are met.</p>
