                <p>In the Victorian Curriculum, the English domain is central to the learning and development of all students. It helps create confident communicators, imaginative thinkers and informed citizens. It is through the study of English that students learn to analyse, understand, communicate with and build relationships with others and with the world around them. In English, students are assessed under three areas: Reading and Viewing, Writing and Speaking and Listening.</p>

                <p>The English domain aims to ensure that students: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Learn to listen to, read, view, speak, write, create and reflect on increasingly complex and sophisticated spoken and written texts across a growing range of contexts with accuracy, fluency and purpose</li>
                    <li>Appreciate, enjoy and use the English language in all its variations and develop a sense of its richness and power to evoke feelings, convey information, form ideas, facilitate interaction with others, entertain, persuade and argue </li>
                    <li>Understand how Standard Australian English works in its spoken and written forms and in combination with non-linguistic forms of communication to create meaning</li>
                </ul>
