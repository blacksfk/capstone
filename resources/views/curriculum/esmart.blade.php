            <p>Courtenay Gardens Primary is committed to teaching our students to be responsible citizens and making great choices, especially when online.</p>

			<p>In 2012, we volunteered to be part of a pilot program run by the Alannah and Madeline Foundation called eSmart Schools. This whole-school inniative is designed to help promote the safe, smart and responsible use of technology inside and outside of school and eliminate cyberbullying in all its forms.</p>

			<p>An eSmart Committe was formed, comprised of teachers, students and parents and we meet monthly to discuss ways to help our school become more eSmart and cybersafe. We have updated our school's Cyberbullying Policy which was approved by the school council.</p>

			<p>Recently the eSmart Committee promoted a whole school contest where students were asked to create a poster promoting the safe and responsible use of technology or cybersafety. We are very pleased to present the winners (right side of page).</p>

			<p>If you have any further questions about the ICT/eSmart program, please feel free to contact us.</p>
