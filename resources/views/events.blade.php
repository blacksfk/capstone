			Each year, the Grade Four students   participate in the &lsquo;You Can Kick Goals!&rsquo; program run by the AFL and Melbourne Football Club. The Grade Four&rsquo;s have had some special guests  visit them at school. Pictured are MFC players Brent Moloney and Jordan Gysberts who met our students and took part in some fun activities.
		</p>
		<p>
			The students participated in a short clinic that included a warm up lead by Brent Moloney and then it was time for some fun football games on the oval. There was also time for the players to speak to the students about themselves and answer a range of questions the students had. To finish off, the students were able to get autographs and a class picture with the players.
		</p>
		<p>
			All students, teachers and players had a great day and hopefully they can come back again next year.

			The “You Can Kicking Goals” - “Mascots” (3 & 4) and “Rookie” (5 & 6) resources provide the students with a work book which reinforces the important values that are integral to the building of stronger and more harmonious communities.  The AFL Learning Management system afllearning.com.au and the AFL Schools website afl.com.au/schools also support the program.
