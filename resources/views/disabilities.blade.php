            <p>CGPS is committed to providing students with disabilities opportunities to access learning and participation in school life. This goal is supported by Susan Grant as the integration coordinator and by the integration aides who work directly with students in classes. The purpose of the integration program is to promote positive behaviour and inclusive practices in all classrooms. 

			Student-centred planning is encouraged. Individual student gaols are incorporated into classroom planning. Goals are reviewed regularly to ensure that they are specific, measureable, attainable, realistic and timely, (SMART).                                                     

			Students are further supported in class with integration aide assistance in some activities and with small group or individual tuition.  

			As well as advice and information, services may include speech pathology, counselling, transition meetings and referrals to additional family services. 

			Student Support Group Meetings are convened regularly to ensure that student goals include individual strengths and competencies with the necessary accommodations and modifications.</p>
